                </div>
                <div id="content-1">
                    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19" target="114"> COVID-19</a> pandemic took the world by surprise.
                        Globally, everything has stopped. Projects have been delayed, workplaces closed and schools shut down. The world seems to have ground to a halt because of the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19" target="90">coronavirus.</a><br>
                        However, students continue their education through online learning and via video calls with their teachers. The model is currently the best alternative as keeping schools open poses a safety risk for students.<br>
                        Globally, many countries have adopted this approach. Schools in New York, the United States, prepared for online learning by distributing gadgets to their students, ensuring they had access to learning materials. As of early April, education authorities distributed around 500,000 laptops and tablets to their students, allowing them to participate in classes online.<br>
                        When the first two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19" target="112"> COVID-19</a> cases in the country was in a panic. However, many schools were not ready to apply home learning programs yet. The online classes implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"> india</a>. This is due to a lack of preparation in this country. <br>
                        As a student participating in the home-learning program, online school was confusing to adjust to as we had not been prepared through simulations or practices beforehand. Students reported the home-learning program to be even more stressful than regular classrooms. Some of the common reasons for this went along the lines of: "Normal classes may have been difficult, but having friends makes it so much more manageable and less stressful. Online classes take out the benefits of having friends to socialize with and being stuck alone with nothing but assignments." <br>
                        Many students participating in home-learning programs also say that the workload of online classes is larger than that of regular classes. The general consensus is that home-learning programs — although highly beneficial and a good alternative to school as schools are closed — still require some getting used to by students. <br>  
                        However, although the closing of schools does have a silver lining (home-learning programs where students are still able to learn), the true sufferers of the government order of school closings are the students in less fortunate situations and the students who are in schools that are not well-funded. <br>
                        This is because those students lack the devices and internet access to be able to participate in online classes, and the schools do not have the capacity to teach online. there is yet to be this kind of effort. <br>
                        This leaves many students in a bad spot where they are unable to receive an education. Although internet service providers have been giving out free data packages, they are simply not capable of supporting video calls on programs such as Zoom, google meet, teams.

                </div>
                <div id="content-1">
                    <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19" target="111"> covid</a> pandemic situation of students in home, spending time with our parents and also we are edicted in social meadia apps, games, movies/web series etc. we are going to waste of time in lockdown. if our parents purchase laptop for us and every day spend some time in it with games, videos etc, it would be a great spend for our parents. After completion of video and game and usually all of us get bored after playing video games for a couple of hours so even if they have bought it for us it will be a waste for them.</p>
                    <p>Trying to achieve our dream goals and passion. spending less time (when possible) and more time actively doing things, with a wider view of what it really means to live our life. making tough decisions and solutions in a much clearer manner than when we are simply trying to win that dream or that long-term goal. 
                        simply focusing on the 'why' of our life in a much more deliberate way and a wider view of life goals.
                        focusing more on growing ourselves in an authentic way, so that we can both genuinely help other people grow as well.
                        chasing after dreams and long-term goals, but pursuing them with good intention and sincerity, instead of doing it as a job or part-time job and not making it our core focus.
                        being an individual and doing things in a way that we truly enjoy, doing things that we want to do, but not needing external rewards to keep us motivated.
                        chasing a much broader view of life than the narrow view of our current world where success and achievement is prioritised.
                        simply being happier, by doing the things that really matter and having much more fulfilling experiences in life.
                        I wrote this article because I found that too many people are busy pursuing pointless and simple goals. However, the real goal is to pursue life and do things that matter to us, and to do it for the right reasons, in a way that we would enjoy and want to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most of the time, we find our life just being far too busy doing pointless things that we don't really like or desire to do. I find that the key to happiness is simply doing things that we genuinely want to do and pursue, as opposed to having to do them to get rewards from our boss or colleagues. If we pursue something purely for the reward and try to win at something in our life, we will find that it makes our life quite miserable and boring, instead of simply achieving our dreams and our passion. 
                        I really do not like grocery shopping and going shopping, it is such a pain for me. I never know what to buy to fill my pantry. I find that the thing that really satisfies me in my food shopping is cooking and having some fantastic food at my finger tips. Cooking and creating something in my life is an amazing opportunity, however it is also quite costly. There are so many other things that I could spend my money on. Sometimes I like to complain about the cost of life. It may seem like a very stupid thing to complain about and I may even say to myself "Why am I spending so much money on such stupid stuff? I should be saving up all of the money so I can enjoy my life, as well as the chance to maybe do some traveling" after pandemic. do create your goals to trying to push youself to achieve your goals.

                    <p class="tip">"stay safe be strong stay healthy, don't go outside during lockdown. take precautions and take immunity food. I hope everyone doing good. support me i'm creating more stuff like this. thank you...!"</p>
